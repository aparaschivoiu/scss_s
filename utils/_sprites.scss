// compass sprites
// here is where you import a directory full of images and compass will generate the sprites for you
// http://maddesigns.de/sass-compass-introduction/#106

// sprite example 
// i'm usig icon as the sprite-map name. use whatever you want. this name comes from the directory in whitch the images are stored.
// $icon-spacing: 10px;   // use this if you need to change spacing between images in your sprite.
// @import "icon/*.png";
// $icon-sprite: sprite-map( "icon/*.png", $spacing: $icon-spacing );  // a variable that might prove useful for some situations. the $spacing as the second value is needed as a workaround for a math bug when offsetting the sprite
