This is the scss_s, or scss for underscores, the wordpress theme.
It's a scss framework that I am developing for personal use, and you are welcome to use it as you wish.
It does not add to the design, it's just a base to start from. You can change it, add to it, tweak it... or just have fun.

scss_s uses Compass and Susy grid so you need to have those gems installed.

Note: The scss files directory should be placed in the wp-content directory, like so:
/wp-content/scss/scss_s/
You shoud rename the directory scss_s to match the theme you're working on. If you choose to place this directory elsewhere, edit the config.rb accordingly.

...and maybe one day I'll update the readme with something useful. =P
