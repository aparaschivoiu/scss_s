This is the scss_s, or scss for underscores, the wordpress theme.
It's a scss framework that I am developing for personal use, and you are welcome to use it as you wish.
It does not add to the design, it's just a base to start from. You can change it, add to it, tweak it... 

I use scss_s with Compass and i'm aiming to change to the Susy grid in the future (still using Blueprint).

Note: The scss files directory should be placed in the wordpress root directory. If you choose to use it elsewhere, edit the config.rb accordingly.

...and maybe one day I'll update the readme with something useful. =P
